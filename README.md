# Morphos Foundation 🌀  
*The open cultural and design foundation behind The Spark.*

## What is Morphos?

**Morphos** is the name for the philosophy and framework behind *The Spark*, the universal symbol of Generative AI.

It is not a company, platform, or product.  
It is a **foundation of principles** — a shared standard of human-centered, generative intelligence.

---

## ✨ Why It Exists

We created The Spark so that no one would ever need to ask what Generative AI *looks like* again.

Morphos exists to ensure that:
- The symbol stays **open** and **free**
- The design stays **human-centered**
- The future of generative tools stays **intentional**, not accidental
